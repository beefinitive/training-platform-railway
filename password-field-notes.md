# Password Field Investigation

The password field in the "Add User" dialog works fine from the browser automation test.
The value "Test123!" was successfully entered into the password field.

The user mentioned the issue is about "إدارة كلمات المرور" (Password Management) page - which is a separate page.
Let me check that page instead.

The user also wants a password change interface within user management.
